# Evidence Policy

## Scope

Use this reference when a task involves novelty, SOTA, superiority, claim support, result wording, contribution framing, evidence gaps, or user-confirmation boundaries.

Do not load this file for simple workspace initialization or purely mechanical formatting.

## Non-Goals

Do not:

- autonomously conduct research;
- automatically run experiments;
- automatically write paper prose after literature search;
- invent results, ablations, metrics, captions, or conclusions;
- claim novelty, superiority, or SOTA without explicit evidence;
- change datasets, splits, metrics, protocols, baselines, or contribution framing without user confirmation;
- optimize for novelty over evidence quality, reproducibility, and real effect.

## Confirmation Checkpoints

Ask the user before:

- changing contribution framing;
- declaring novelty or SOTA;
- choosing the final method direction;
- removing or replacing strong baselines;
- changing dataset, split, metric, or evaluation protocol;
- converting speculative refinements into final paper claims;
- downgrading or excluding a source if that decision materially affects the paper narrative.

## Claims

Do not write unsupported academic claims into paper sections without recording them in `claims.md`.

For every nontrivial claim, distinguish whether support comes from:

- literature;
- code;
- config;
- verified logs;
- user-provided result;
- user-stated intent;
- assumption;
- unverified inference.

Claims marked unsupported or speculative must not appear as final conclusions.

## Evidence vs Prose Tone

Evidence control is not rebuttal prose.

Keep unsupported claims out of final conclusions without automatically promoting every risk into the manuscript.

Use the claim ledger to track risks, missing evidence, and reviewer-sensitive issues. In public prose, expose only the handling that improves reader interpretation: direct statement, compact scope boundary, limitations placement, or omission from public prose.

## Results

Do not write experimental results unless the user provides numbers or verified logs.

**Verified Log Detection:**
Search for files that provide direct, timestamped, or serial evidence of execution. Look for:
- Standard log folders: `logs/`, `runs/`, `checkpoints/`, `results/`.
- File formats: `.log`, `.jsonl` (e.g., from `training_log.jsonl`), `.yaml` (config/summary), `.csv` (metric dumps).
- Tool-specific outputs: `wandb/`, `tensorboard/`, or Hydra output directories.

For results, you may only:

- create table structures;
- define metric columns;
- prepare neutral captions;
- mark missing cells as `TODO`;
- list required experiments.

Avoid interpretive wording such as "outperforms", "achieves SOTA", or "significantly improves" unless validated evidence supports that exact claim under the same dataset, split, metric, and protocol.

## Evidence Strength

Venue rank is not evidence. Final evidence strength depends on:

- relevance;
- method clarity;
- baseline strength;
- evaluation fairness;
- dataset, metric, and split transparency;
- code or reproducibility support;
- claim-evidence alignment.
