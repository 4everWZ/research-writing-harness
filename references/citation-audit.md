# Citation Audit and Claim Ledger

## Scope

Use this reference when checking whether citations support claims, whether novelty is overclaimed, whether related work is distorted, or whether paper sections contain unsupported statements.

## Core Principle

A citation is valid only if it supports the exact claim being made.

Do not treat a related paper as support for a stronger, broader, or different claim.

## Claim Ledger

Every nontrivial academic claim should be recorded in `claims.md`.

Claim types:

- `background`;
- `method`;
- `experiment`;
- `comparison`;
- `limitation`;
- `speculation`.

Evidence status:

- `supported`;
- `partially_supported`;
- `unsupported`;
- `speculative`.

Claims marked `unsupported` or `speculative` must not appear as final conclusions.

## Audit Procedure

1. Read the target section.
2. Extract nontrivial claims.
3. Match each claim to `claims.md` when possible.
4. Check whether cited sources directly support the claim.
5. Downgrade overbroad claims.
6. Mark missing evidence.
7. Suggest precise revisions.

## Common Failure Modes

Flag these cases:

- citation supports the general topic but not the exact claim;
- citation is based only on the abstract;
- novelty claim ignores recent strong work;
- SOTA claim does not match dataset, split, metric, or protocol;
- method superiority is claimed without user-provided results;
- weak or downgraded sources are used as key evidence;
- arXiv is used as the only support for a central theoretical claim;
- venue prestige is used as evidence quality.

## Strong Revision Pattern

Instead of:

```text
Existing methods fail to model frequency-spatial interactions effectively.
```

Use a scoped version:

```text
Several prior methods incorporate frequency-domain or spatial interaction mechanisms, but their design choices differ in where and how cross-domain information is fused.
```

Then cite only papers that actually support the scoped statement.

## Output Format

When reporting an audit, use:

1. Supported claims;
2. Partially supported claims;
3. Unsupported or speculative claims;
4. Citation mismatches;
5. Required revisions;
6. Files updated.
